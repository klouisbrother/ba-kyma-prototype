## Introduction

This repository contains a Microservice prototype which is based on Kyma Runtime, on SAP Business Technology Platform. The intention of this prototype is to extend a cloud-based e-commerce applications, SAP Commerce Cloud (Hybris) with a Kyma Runtime based Microservice.

The prototype was created as part of my Bachelor-Thesis with the translated title "Microservices to extend cloud-based e-commerce applications" at FOM Hochschule f√ºr Oekonomie & Management, in Munich, Germany. The Bachelor-Thesis and the kyma-prototype has been created in the time between 2021-02-23 and 2021-06-22.

## Use-Case

The the kyma-based Microservice should be able to process an event which can be triggered by a monolithic application like the SAP Commerce Cloud. This should show the possibilities of Kyma. This should include the Service Catalog, Service Mesh and xxxx
