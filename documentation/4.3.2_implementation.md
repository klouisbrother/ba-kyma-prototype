# Chapter 4.3.2: Implementation

Within this chapter the following steps will be performed and are described below:

* Creation of namespace for the microservice (this time via the Kyma GUI)
* Deployment of the pre-developed microservice image (this time via the Kyma GUI)

## Deployment of Microservice "order-service" as sample functionality

### Installation via GUI

1. Create a new namespace via GUI via name "orders-service". No further details have to be added.

2. Clone the Github Repository https://github.com/kyma-project/examples/tree/main/orders-service to you local machine. This Repository includes the needed deployment files ([orders-service-deployment.yaml](https://github.com/kyma-project/examples/blob/main/orders-service/deployment/orders-service-deployment.yaml) and [orders-service-service.yaml](https://github.com/kyma-project/examples/blob/main/orders-service/deployment/orders-service-service.yaml))

3. Select the namespace "orders-service", click on "Deploy new workload" and select the cloned / copied [orders-service-deployment.yaml](https://github.com/kyma-project/examples/blob/main/orders-service/deployment/orders-service-deployment.yaml)

4. Again, click on "Deploy new workload" and select the cloned / copied [orders-service-service.yaml](https://github.com/kyma-project/examples/blob/main/orders-service/deployment/orders-service-service.yaml)

5. After a short time, the in the deployment files described ressources are available and running

### Alternative: Installation via Command Line

As also shown in [Chapter 4.3.1: Prerequisites for implementation](https://github.com/klouisbrother/ba-kyma-prototype/blob/main/documentation/4.3.1_prerequisites.md), the creation of the namespace and deployment of the .yaml-files could also be done via command line.
